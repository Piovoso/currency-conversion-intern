# currency-conversion-intern
 Intern test for Playtech, it took me around 3 hours of actual coding and 2 hours of trying to figure out why python didn't want to cooperate.
 
 ## Required Python modlues
 - Pandas (for displaying the Table of intermediary currency conversions, easiest method)
 - IPython (easiest and best functionality for displaying anything related to Pandas)
 - jinja2 (required by IPython)
 - requests (Built-in, necessary for making API Requests.)
 - math (Built-in, required trunc function)
 
 ## Final words
 Honestly, i had fun with this project, i know it might not be the best looking code, or the fastest, but it's something i built.
 Will i use it in the future? Most likely no.
 Will i come back to steal some methods i liked? for sure.
 To be fully honest, this is my first time with API's and actually undestanding how python dictionaries work, it was fun.
